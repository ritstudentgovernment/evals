      <h3>The Existing Solution</h3>
      <p>Currently RIT contracts with a third-party to provide the SmartEvals system.</p>
      <h3>Time for Change</h3>
      <p>The Student Government Services Team identified a number of problems with SmartEvals, all of which are addressed by OpenEvals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Terrible Mobile Experience - The experience for SmartEvals on a mobile device is terrible, requiring pinching and zooming. The bottom line is, if you want to review your courses, you have to do it on the desktop. That's not good enough in 2015 (or 2010).</li>
        <li>Terrible Desktop Experience - SmartEvals was not designed with the right user in mind - the student. OpenEvals was designed from the ground up to have a fantastic mobile and desktop experience. This is software you want to use.</li>
        <li>No Incentive to Review - Because students don't get access to SmartEvals data, participation rates are low. By requiring that students submit two evaluations prior to accessing data, we encourage robust participation and a healthy collection of data. </li>
        <li>Encourages use of RateMyProfessor - When students don't have a legitimate place to voice their opinions, they have to resort to unprofessional and unreliable sites like RateMyProfessor. Even worse, students are left with no option but to consider RateMyProfessor as the only available source of course information. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Defending Transparency</h3>
      <p>You deserve to know how RIT's professors are doing. By keeping review data from students, SmartEvals has established itself as an enemy to transparency. </p>
      <h3>Working with our Faculty</h3>
      <p>In order to protect our faculty, at the request of provost Haefner, OpenEvals is only accessible to students. </p>
