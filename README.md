About
=====

OpenEvals is a web application for collecting and presenting course evaluation data. In its current state, OpenEvals would work out-of-the box as a standalone evaluation system. 

In the future, a branch will be created that presents data from SmartEvals. 

Usage (Local Development)
=========================

- Install [Meteor].
- Copy `settings.json.sample` to `settings.json` and edit appropriately.
- From the root directory, run `meteor --settings settings.json`.
